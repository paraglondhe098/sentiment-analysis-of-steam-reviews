"as good as gta is, dont buy it. Dont support rockstar making dumb decisions, removing content, bringing back content from years ago and branding it as a"" new update"", game is full of hackers, your ip is literally accesible to every 3 year old with a mod menu, plenty of bugs, rockstar does not give a single ???? about its community. Whatever you say, rockstar doesnt care and only does what its investors say."
Still the best game available.
private is fine but public you will all ways find some who's uses mod's
